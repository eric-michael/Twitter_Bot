This program uses the Twitter API to collect a tweet from a specified user and retweet it (with modified text) with your account.

To do so, you must create a Twitter Developer application to receive the necessary credentials (app keys, etc.).

How to generate a bearer token: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens.

All of the instructions can be found through the Twitter Developer documentation: https://developer.twitter.com/en.html
